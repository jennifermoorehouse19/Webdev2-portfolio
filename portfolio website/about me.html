<p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Moorehouse I am currently a full time student studying Creative Digital Media in ITB I am 19 years old and I was born on the 24th of August 1999 I live in Finglas Dublin 11 but I originaly lived in Ballymun. I used to go to a secondary school in Finglas called St.Michaels secondary school. I wanted to do the course Creative Digital Media because I liked the creative aspect of the course and I also liked the variety in the course and that there is various job opportunities. </p>

<p>In Creative Digital Media I have many modules which are studio photography and image production, design process and practice, storytelling and narrative, web development and universal design. I am now in my second semester in first year. In my first semester the modules were web development, digital photography, creative development, visual creativity, and introduction to digital media. My favourite module in the course is Photography I really like taking photographs and love that you can be as creative as you want I also really like web development because you can create a website and can be creative with it.</p>
	
<p>Im not sure what I want to do when I finish college but I would love to get into something were I can be creative and unique I feel that I would probably like to get a job in photogtaphy, photoshop or web development. I also love travelling so I hope to get a job maybe outside of Dublin or a job were I travel a lot. In Creative Digital Media we do a lot of stuff to help build our CV at the start of the first semester we made masks for An Draiocht and in the second semester we made stuff for Dell I have learned a lot from this course and feel that it is a great experience.</p>
